The `spotify` media player platform allows you to control
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) playback from Home Assistant.

## {% linkable_title Prerequisites %}

- Spotify account
- Spotify application, properly configured (see below)

<p class='note'>
Controlling the Spotify component (pause, play, next, etc.) requires a Premium account. If you do not have a Premium account, the component in the frontend will not show the controls.
</p>

To create the required Spotify application:

- Login to [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com)
- Visit the [My Applications](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications) page
- Select **Create An App**. Enter any name and description. Once your application is created, view it and copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, which are used in the Home Assistant configuration file.
- Add a **Redirect URI** in one of the following forms:

 If you are not using SSL:
  `http://<your_home_assistant_url_or_local_ip>:<port>/api/spotify`

 If you are using SSL:
  `https://<your_home_assistant_url_or_local_ip>:<port>/api/spotify`

 The URL is whatever you use to access Home Assistant from outside your network
 (including port if applicable).

- Click **Save** after adding the URI.

You will likely also need to set the `base_url` attribute of the [HTTP Component](/components/http/). This should be set using the same base URL as the redirect URI, e.g., if you used a domain name (not local IP) in the redirect, then use the same domain name in your `base_url`.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To add Spotify to your installation,
add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: spotify
    client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    aliases:
        abc123def456: 'Living Room'
        9183abas000: 'Bed Room'
```

{% configuration %}
client_id:
  description: Client ID from your Spotify application.
  required: true
  type: string
client_secret:
  description: Client Secret from your Spotify application.
  required: true
  type: string
cache_path:
  description: Path to cache authentication token.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: .spotify-token-cache
aliases:
  description: "Dictionary of device ids to be aliased, handy for devices that Spotify cannot properly determine the device name of. New devices will be logged to the `info` channel for ease of aliasing."
  required: false
  type: map
name:
  description: The name of the device used in the frontend.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Spotify

{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Setup %}

After the prerequisites and configuration are complete, restart Home Assistant.
A **Spotify** configurator element will be available. Follow the instructions to
authorize Home Assistant to access your Spotify account. A Spotify media player
will then appear. If you are prompted to download a file after completing
authorization, discard the download. It is not needed.

## {% linkable_title Sources %}
The sources are based on if you have streamed to these devices before in
Spotify. If you don't have any sources, then simply stream from your phone to
another device in your house: Bluetooth, echo, etc. Once you do, the sources will
show up in the developer console as a device to cast/stream to. The devices won't show up in the dev-console as sources unless they are powered on as well.

## {% linkable_title URI Links For Playlists/Etc. %}
You can send playlists to spotify via the `"media_content_type": "playlist"` and something like (depending on your content ID)
`"media_content_id": "spotify:user:spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DWSkkUxEhrBdF"`
which are part of the
[media_player.play_media](/components/media_player/#service-media_playerplay_media)
service. You can test this from the services
control panel in the Home Assistant frontend.

The above playlist example is a URI link to the "Reggae Infusions" playlist.
[This support document from Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/sharing-music/)
explains how to get this URI value to use for playlists in the Spotify component.

## {% linkable_title Unsupported Devices %}

- **Sonos**: Although Sonos is a Spotify Connect device, it is not supported by the official Spotify API.
